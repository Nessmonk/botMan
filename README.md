# botMan

## Simple bot made by Nessmonk#7550
Created in Node.JS with Discord.Js, Nodemon and Discord commando.
Base prefix is ">", you can change that by going into config.json and changing the prefix to anything you want.
Most commands speak for themselves. Still going to add comments to code for readability.

## Commands

>help: Simple help command showing all available commands (manually added, no algorithm for whenever I add a command yet.)

>info: Shows you simple information about yourself (Username, Nickname, Status etc)

>8ball: Rolls the 8ball with a switch with 8 different answers.

>flip: Flips a coin with Math.Random 

>color: Creates a random hex code and adds that to a link so it displays the random color

>uptime: Checks the uptime of the bot

>invite: Creates an invite for the bot, could be shortened with goo.gl or bit.ly but cba to get an API key so I can do that.
